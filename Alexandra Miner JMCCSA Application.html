Windsor, ON N9C 4C2</p>

<p>April 3, 2024</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Wilcox,</p> 
<p class="first-line-indent">As an educator who is deeply committed to fostering an equitable learning environment, I am eager to contribute to your multidisciplinary team as an Occasional Teacher. 
With a focus on supporting students with diverse learning and motivational needs, 
I am particularly drawn to the unique challenges and opportunities that arise in schools dedicated to providing specialized education alongside rehabilitation and treatment services.
Throughout my career, I have embraced the importance of individualized support and meaningful engagement for all students. 
My experiences supporting people with exceptionalities, including roles at Community Living, Autism Services Inc., and the Windsor Essex Catholic District School Board 
has equipped me with tools and insight into creating and implementing Individualized Education Plans tailored to meet the unique needs of each student. 
These experiences have reinforced my belief that child-centered and inclusive education is imperative in providing students with their fundamental right to quality education.
Currently, I am contributing to the educational community as an occasional teacher with the Windsor Essex Catholic District School Board. 
I was grateful to teach a determined student living with physical and developmental needs during a long-term assignment. 
My experience with this student refined my methods, focusing on ensuring students could access the curriculum meaningfully and recognize their integral role in our classroom community. 
Overall, this role provided me with valuable insights into the educational landscape of our community, 
revealing the critical need for inclusivity and equity in educational programs to ensure all students can thrive.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the
possibility of contributing to the continued success and growth of John
McGivney Children’s Centre School Authority. I look forward to the
opportunity to discuss how my experiences and skills align with the needs
of your school community.</p>

To Whome this May Concern, <br>

<p class="first-line-indent"> I am writing this letter in support of Allie Miner as a candidate for the JMCC
school authority. I have had the pleasure of working with Allie, on and off,
for the past 12 summers that she has been employed at Autism Services’
Bruce Awad Summer Program. As a valuable member of our Summer
Program staff, Allie has worked as a Support Worker and later becoming a
Supervisor for our program.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Allie displays the characteristics of a mature, responsible, and caring
individual through her actions and commitment to fine tuning her
communication and leadership skills. Through her past supervisor
experience with our organization, Allie brings an enthusiastic and
self-driven work ethic that benefits her and the classroom. Allie would
frequently advocate for both the staff & students that she oversees and
interacts with and our organization in general when in the public eye. Allie
works efficiently and responsibly under circumstances where adaptive
measures are needed related to student behaviour and classroom routine.
She consistently seeks out feedback from fellow Supervisors and
Co-Directors alike regarding her work ethic. She perseveres through
challenges that she encounters in her classroom routine and is resolute in
her commitment to meeting and exceeding the daily expectations of our
program. Through these qualities, Allie will excel as a caring and
knowledgeable educator in her future endeavours.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Allie consistently portrays courteous and professional mannerisms
throughout her experience with our program. She commits her time with
our program by following our policies and procedures in every situation.
Understanding the responsibility of representing the organization, Allie
actively promotes the program when the opportunity arises in the public.
She is a hard-working individual who seeks opportunities to learn and
practice her skill set. Her work ethic does not go unnoticed by everyone
she works with, and staff and I have nothing but praise for her commitment
to all program goals and expectations set out for the program’s success.
Allie’s kind nature and likeable personality will no doubt benefit her
professional growth.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Communication is vital to our Summer Program. Staff are expected to
communicate daily with parents and guardians through one-on-one
discussions, writing government reports and communication logs. Allie
excels at talking with parents and effectively communicating the essential
information to her class on a consistent basis. Allie interacts with her
students through energetic, spirited, and sociable mannerisms that benefit
the staff and students through their engagement in activities. She displays
an adept ability to communicate with staff and administration that allows
her to feel confident in her abilities as a responsible individual. Allie
collaborates with every staff member she interacts with which allows
cohesive flow in the classroom routine. These qualities are by far, some of
Allie’s strengths.</p>
<p class="first-line-indent">Whenever faced with a situation in our Summer Program requiring
well-developed problem-solving skills, Allie consistently offers insightful
feedback and provides unique solutions to problems. Through our
program, Allie exudes confidence when it comes to programming and
implementing coping strategies with our students with Autism. Routine
plays an important role in our everyday schedules, but it is also important
to problem solve and adapt to the behaviours of our students. As a
Supervisor, Allie is a resourceful individual in using and trying new
procedures with the students by incorporating inquisitive and adaptable
strategies accordingly. Allie is resourceful using different materials and
efficient problem-solving strategies with the students to help overcome
daily obstacles.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Working for our program and organization, staff are expected to show
understanding and empathy towards all parents, students, and staff
involved. Understanding what it is like to have a child with Autism allows
all staff to see and experience Autism on many different levels. Allie, from
the start of her employment with our Summer Program, persistently
showed resolve in every action she took. Her caring, sociable and
team-orientated personality allows others to see her delicate approach to
understanding our students’ abilities and how to engage them to the best
of their potential. Allie learns strategies that best help the students achieve
their maximum potential. She dedicates her time and attention to engaging
students while adapting to every individual’s social-emotional stage and
helps them through their difficulties. Allie actively listens to staff, students,
and parents alike and takes to heart every learning opportunity to best
relate empathetically to each need of our families.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Having known Allie in a professional manner as a director and seeing her
growth through the years being employed by our Autism Summer Program,
it makes me extremely proud to see her continued goals to achieve
success. Allie undoubtedly possesses many skills that will serve her in her
academic drive to be a responsible, hard-working professional in the
education field. Her reliable character and willingness to advocate for the
needs of others will mold her into a dedicated leader in her profession for
years to come. Allie’s innate ability to collaborate with many people in
many different roles and communicate effectively and efficiently, will truly
make her a well-rounded professional. I am very proud to have known Allie
through her time spent with our agency and know that she brings forth a
resolve to be the best in every professional manner. </p>

Sincerely, <br>
Sean Crawford

To Whole It May Concern,<br>

<p class="first-line-indent">Please accept this letter of reference for Alexandra Miner. Allie
completed a challenging long term teaching assignment from November
9, 2022 to June 16, 2023 as a Grade 8 Teacher during the 2022/2023
school year at St. Gabriel School. This position was constantly evolving
from month to month. The teacher was expected back to work but as
time progressed, Allie found herself immersed in the role as the full time
classroom teacher for the majority of the school year. She
accommodated all that was asked of her for the consistency and well
being of her students.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Allie worked extremely hard at St. Gabriel school. She was put into a
position where she had to formally assess student work and complete
report cards for the first time after only knowing her students for a short
time. She embraced this challenge and did an exceptional job. She was
put in a position where she had to participate in parent-teacher
interviews, grade 8 transition meetings, graduation preparation and a
schoolwide activity day. Allie also completed the June report cards for
her grade 8 students. Her comments, structure and professionalism were
that of a veteran teacher.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">While Allie did a great job performing the day to day duties of a grade
teacher, her focus was always on curriculum and delivering the program
to meet the needs of all her students. She spent many long hours
preparing for each day, oftentimes coming in on weekends to be
prepared for the week ahead. Allie is an extremely hard worker and does
a great job with planning. She was never hesitant to reach out for
assistance with respect to assessment and evaluation, the new MathUp
resource or strategies on managing behaviors in the classroom. She
managed her classroom very well and was eager to learn new ideas from
the veteran teachers and support staff around her which are the assets
of a true professional!</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Allie deserves a great deal of credit for her accomplishments as a grade
8 teacher this school year. She handled herself with professionalism and
demonstrated genuine care for her students. Her students respected her
and she was able to handle all parent meetings with grace and
professionalism. Allie’s attendance at the grade 8 graduation (after her
assignment was complete) did not go unnoticed by staff, parents and
most importantly, her students.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Allie has demonstrated that she is an individual who cares about her
profession, her professional development and the well-being of her
students. She has an extremely strong work ethic and a passion for
student learning. I strongly recommend Allie Miner for a full time
teaching position within our board.</p>
Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions
with respect to Alexandra Miner at 519-969-3230 or
bob_flanagan@wecdsb.on.ca.<br><br>

To Whom It May Concern,<br>
<p class="first-line-indent">I am writing this letter of recommendation for Ms. Alexandra Miner. I
had the opportunity to work with Ms. Miner on a few occasion as an
After School tutor, an Occasional Teacher, and as a volunteer at both
Immaculate Conception School and WJ Langlois School.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Alexandra was a welcome addition. She consistently had a positive and
cheerful attitude, was a well organized self-starter, and always
presented a sense of calm and confidence when working with her
students. During the after school program at Immaculate Conception
School, Alexandra was extremely creative in engaging her young
learners through a variety of diverse lessons and her students were
always excited about their new learning opportunities. This year, she
came to WJ Langlois to volunteer in the Grade 7/8 classroom. She was
able to create and nurture a positive and safe environment for her
students as a teacher and as a volunteer.</p>

<p class="first-line-indent">Alexandra’s kindness and compassion toward members of our school
community, her ability to work collaboratively with others, and her
overall professionalism are clearly characteristics that I personally
respect and value. I would welcome Ms. Miner as a permanent staff
member in my own school and believe that she would be an asset and
a blessing to any school community.</p>
If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.<br><br>
